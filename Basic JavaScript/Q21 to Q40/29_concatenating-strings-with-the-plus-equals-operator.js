// Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: This is the first sentence. and This is the second sentence. using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the example and be sure to include a space between the two strings. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.

let myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";

console.log(myStr)
